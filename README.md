Is the game boring? You're a server administrator and want to make your server more interesting. 
Make players watch out for and relight the torches they put down after a certain period of time. 
Then try Temporary Torch. This plugin will make the torches last for a period of time before they disappear, 
with a chance to return the materials at the location where they disappeared. 
This forces players to gather materials and craft to relight the locations after a certain period.
